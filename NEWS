Version 1.6, released 2011-08-22
--------------------------------

* Manual page's SYNOPSIS and OPTIONS sections are now generated automatically
  by cliapp's `--generate-manpage`.

Version 1.5, released 2011-06-12
--------------------------------

* Fix genbackupdatalib to work better with pydoc.
* Change to use newer cliapp API for adding new settings. This avoids
  the deprecated old API.

Version 1.3.1, released 2011-02-02
----------------------------------

* Fix setup.py so that the genbackupdatalib Python library is
  included in the package.

Version 1.3, released 2011-02-01
--------------------------------

* Rewrite from scratch, becaue the old code was hard to test.
  It was also full of features nobody uses. New code is small.
