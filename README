genbackupdata
=============

genbackupdata creates test data for testing backup programs. The
data is entirely syntethic, but just good enough to be of some little
use.

The output is deterministic, such that for a given set of parameters the
same output always happens. Thus it is more efficient to distribute
genbackupdata and a set of parameters between people who wish to
benchmark backup software than distributing very large test sets.
