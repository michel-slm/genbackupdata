genbackupdata (1.3) squeeze; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is a rewrite. It is not as functional
    as the old code. But it is functional enough, and I'm the only
    known user, so...

genbackupdata (1.2) squeeze; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This release uses a new way to generate binary
    junk, which is faster than the previous one, and does not result in
    repetition of existing binary blocks. Obnam is now so good in
    noticing duplication that it would store a one gigabyte data set
    from genbackupdata in 132 kilobytes.
  * Update my e-mail address in Maintainer.
