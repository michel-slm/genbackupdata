Description: generate test data sets for backup software
 genbackupdata creates or modifies directory trees in ways that simulate
 real filesystems sufficiently well for performance testing of backup
 software. For example, it can create files that are a mix of small text
 files and big binary files, with the binary files containing random
 binary junk which compresses badly. This can then be backed up, and
 later the directory tree can be changed by creating new files, modifying
 files, or deleting or renaming files. The backup can then be run again.
